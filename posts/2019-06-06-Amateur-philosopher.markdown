title: A paradox of determinism
---

*A puzzle by another puzzle*

--

So a recurring thought I had was that of a deterministic world. 

This was the idea that everything was linked somehow and caused some sort of reaction to other things.

A result of this would be the ability to simulate and predict the future with exactness.

In order then to predict to future, one **being** must then have all these information.

Based on the assumption that given the knowledge of everything,

the future would be deterministic. 

One might then assert that the **being** would have act in a determined way.

However, if the **being** is made aware of this, could he not decide to act in another way?

> Is it possible to **simulate** this in a smaller context?

> *looks like I made another rabbit hole... Leaving these thoughts here as they are rather going in...*

Let me know if you have any ideas to crack this funny thought I had.
