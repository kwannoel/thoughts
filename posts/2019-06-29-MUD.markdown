*Text-based multiplayer games*

---

Recently I found out about a game format, MUD which linked to something I was thinking about for a long time.

Multiplayer games on telegram with a persistent state.

Perhaps this would be a good way to run virtual board games. (I'm a collector!)

Also, I was quite inspired by dwarf fortress, DCSS and NetHack. Would like to build a multiplayer rogue-like game as well.
