title: Using multiple screens

---

In order to use multi screens in a linux system, one can use xrandr via CLI.
There are good docs in ARCH wiki to reference.
Alternatively, I used arandr which provides a minimal GUI for ordering screens.
Arandr outputs the xrandr command required to set this up.
You can then map this to a hotkey.
