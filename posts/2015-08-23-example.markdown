Dear Reader,

I've been writing for a while now, scattershot throughout github, wordpress and Instagram.

Free github pages are the final piece of the puzzle and it's high time I assembled my **thoughts**.

I have too many thoughts spinning in and out of orbit; by writing I structure these brain farts.

I hope you pick up some things of value and feel free to approach me in person for a discussion :)

Regards,
Noel
