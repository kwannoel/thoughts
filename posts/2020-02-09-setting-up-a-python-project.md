title: Declarative package management with python
---

Tried out pyAutoGUI this weekend and took sometime to figure out python's
configuration system. 

--

Currently am using `conda`, which provides virtual
environments to sandbox project dependencies for python. The getting started guide does not show a way
to do declarative package management however.

After reading up more, I found it nested deeper inside conda's documentation. 

Here are the relevant links:

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-from-file

Will be updating this post shortly, with a link to the project repository to
show an example.
