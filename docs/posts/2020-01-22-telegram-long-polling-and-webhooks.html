<p>While trying to update the <code>telegram-bot crate</code> for <code>Rust</code> to implement the webhooks functionality I did some readings. Here are my findings:</p>
<p><strong>Long Polling</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally clients performed requests to servers and there was no way for servers to push information to clients.</p>
<p>To circumvent this clients poll servers requesting new info. When servers respond, and the client receives new info, it immediately sends another request out to the server.</p>
<p>In the context of telegram bots, the getUpdates method is used to perform polling to the main telegram servers (not your server instance for the telegram bot). When thereâ€™s an update, this sends the response to your server instance and you can repeat the polling process.</p>
<p><strong>WebHooks</strong></p>
<p>The alternative is to use webhooks. We setup a server to handle incoming updates and set the webhook to use the server route. Whenever the main servers receive an update, they push the update to your server.</p>
<p>Notice that instead of having to poll the main servers repeatedly (long polling), the main servers perform the push of the update to your server instance once the webhook is set.</p>
